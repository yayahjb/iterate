INSTALLATION

Before installation, ensure that you have a complete kit as
shown in the file MANIFEST.  If you think Makefile has been
corrupted, make a fresh copy from Makefile_save.  The files
ciftbx.f, ciftbx.cmn, ciftbx.cmf, ciftbx.cmv, ciftbx.sys and 
hash_funcs.f are from the CIFtbx2 kit.  They are needed in 
order to read and write CIFs.  If you need an update to 
CIFtbx2, see
  http://ndbserver.rutgers.edu/software/ciftbx

The complete ITERATE suite consists of a the fortran
program ITERATE, an html web page iterate.html, and
a cgi-bin script iterate.csh.  The web page and script
need some definitions for each system.  They are built
from m4 macro documents by make, using a command file
Makefile, which must contain the appropriate definitions.

In order to install the program, you need to edit the file
Makefile, setting the following parameters appropriately for
your system:

HTTPDSERVER is the name of the server on which the installation 
is being made.  YOU MUST CHANGE THIS DEFINITION TO PERMIT 
REMOTE ACCESS.  The default definition is:

HTTPDSERVER	=	localhost

BINDEST is the installation directory for the executable of ITERATE.
CGIBIN is the installation directory for the cgi-bin script iterate.csh
CGIBINEXT is the external name of the directory for the cgi-bin 
script iterate.csh. HTDOCS is the installation directory for the 
HTML document iterate.html.  The following are normal defaults 
for a system manager installation assuming an NCSA httpd default 
installation.

BINDEST		=	/usr/local/bin
CGIBIN		=	/usr/local/etc/httpd/cgi-bin
CGIBINEXT	=	/cgi-bin
HTDOCS		=	/usr/local/etc/httpd/htdocs

For a user installation you need the system manager to have permitted 
cgi-bin execution from the directory given.  The following lines, with 
the "??????" replaced by a valid user name are a possible start on 
user installation definitions

USERNAME	=	??????
BINDEST		=	/home/$(USERNAME)/bin
CGIBIN		=	/home/$(USERNAME)/public_html/cgi-bin
CGIBINEXT	=	/~$(USERNAME)/cgi-bin
HTDOCS		=	/home/$(USERNAME)/public_html

The default compile flag definition to select debug mode under unix is

FFLAGS	=	-g

For IBM AIX xlf compilation with full optimization try this

FFLAGS	=	-O3 -qstrict
FC	=	xlf

The following flag normally does not need to be changed.

HTFLAGS 	=	-DFULLHTDOCS=$(CGIPATH)

However, for use with wwwcount2.3

HTFLAGS	=	-DFULLHTDOCS=$(CGIPATH) -DWWWCOUNT=TRUE

Once you have completed your edit, then

      make edit_done
      make all

If you are the system manager and have set the definitions
appropriately, then you can use

      make install

to install the program, web page and cgi-bin script.

OPERATION

The program may be operated as a stand-alone program, reading
data from stdin, writing output to stdout and messages to stderr.
Three environment variables control the operation of the program
in stand-alone mode:

ITERATE_QUERY           set to NO if the program is to run a single pass
OUTPUT_STYLE            set to CIF if the output is to be a CIF
INPUT_STYLE             set to CIF if the input is to be a CIF

If the input is a CIF, the following tokens are expected:

    _cell.entry_id           a character string to associate with the cell
    _cell.space_group_name_H-M
                             a space group symbol (used only for centering)
    _cell.length_a           the length in Angstroms of cell edge a with esd
    _cell.length_b           the length in Angstroms of cell edge b with esd
    _cell.length_c           the length in Angstroms of cell edge c with esd
    _cell.angle_alpha        the cell angle alpha in degrees with esd
    _cell.angle_beta         the cell angle beta in degrees with esd
    _cell.angle_gamma        the cell angle gamma in degrees with esd

When esd's are given they should be given as parenthesized digits, as
in
    _cell.length_a    100.5(3)
for a cell edge of 100.5 +/- .3

When no esd's are given the program forces in minimal defaults.

If the input is not a CIF, then the information to be provided is
a lattice centering symbol (P, F, etc.), then a line with three
cell edge lengths and angles, and finally a line with with three
edge length esd's in Angstroms (not final digits) and cell angle esd's
in degrees.

If the output is a cif, the following tokens are used:

        data_G6_SEARCH
        loop_
        _cell.entry_id
        _cell.id
        _cell.space_group_name_H-M
        _cell.Bravais_lattice_symbol
        _cell.length_a
        _cell.length_b
        _cell.length_c
        _cell.angle_alpha
        _cell.angle_beta
        _cell.angle_gamma
        _cell.unreduced_length_a
        _cell.unreduced_length_b
        _cell.unreduced_length_c
        _cell.unreduced_angle_alpha
        _cell.unreduced_angle_beta
        _cell.unreduced_angle_gamma

The last six are used to report the centered, rather than primitive
cell.

What Does This Web Page Do? 

   
   
   In simple terms, what this page does is to find the cells which are
   "close" to the cell given, in order to help find the Bravais lattice
   of highest symmetry consistent with the cell.
   
   A central problem in the solution of every crystal structure is to
   determine the correct Bravais lattice of the crystal. The Bravais
   lattices as they are usually listed are:
   
   aP triclinic (anorthic) primitive
   mP monoclinic primitive
   mS monoclinic side-centered (usually C-centered)
   oP orthorhombic primitive
   oS orthorhombic side-centered
   oF orthorhombic face-centered
   oI orthorhombic body-centered
   hP hexagonal primitive
   hR hexagonal rhombohedrally-centered
   tP tetragonal primitive
   tI tetragonal body-centered
   cP cubic primitive
   cF cubic face-centered
   cI cubic body-centered
   
   
   Failure to find the highest correct symmetry has several consequences,
   the worst of which is that the structure may not be solved. The least
   of the consequences is that Richard Marsh may publish a paper that
   points out the error, corrects it, and finds a better solution to the
   structure. Many methods have been described for finding the correct
   Bravais lattice. A summary of the published methods was published in
   the paper that described the G6 formalism (which is used in the
   program on this web page).
   
   "Lattices and Reduced Cells as Points in 6-Space and Selection of
   Bravais Lattice Type by Projections." Lawrence C. Andrews and Herbert
   J. Bernstein, Acta Crystallographica, A44, 1009-1018 (1988).
   
   The program on this Web page implements a search in G6 for the various
   Bravais lattices that the user's cell may fit. For each lattice type,
   the best metric match is reported. If the higher symmetry type is
   actually correct, then that is likely to be the best cell from which
   to start further refinement. However, the possibility exists that one
   of the rejected cells (which did not match as well) was actually the
   correct one to use. The reason for this ambiguity is experimental
   error and its propagation in the transformations of the lattices in
   the program. Fortunately, the rejected cells are usually quite similar
   to the accepted one.
   
   A note on standard deviations: First, even in the best of
   circumstances, standard deviations of unit cell dimensions from
   4-circle diffractometer data are always underestimated (by at least a
   factor of 2). In addition, the points chosen for the determination are
   often not well distributed (for example all in the first octant of
   orthorhombic lattices). These less than optimal choices cause
   substantial systematic error. The experimental errors are amplified in
   the mathematical conversions between various lattices that any lattice
   search program must perform. It is not a rare occurrence for angles to
   be incorrect by 0.5 degrees in initial unit cell determinations.
   
   Note: Even in most well determined unit cells, the actual errors in
   the edge lengths is 0.2 to 0.5 parts per thousand. (Note that
   reproducibility of the measurements is substantially better, leading
   to the illusion that diffractometers produce excellent unit cell
   parameters). Use of standard deviations that are too small is a common
   reason for failure of Bravais lattice searches. For small molecules,
   0.1 Angstroms is a reasonable error for the edge lengths, for
   proteins, 0.4 to 0.5 (or even more for preliminary measurements).
   Accurate unit cell parameters must by determined by a number of more
   complex methods and must include extrapolation to remove systematic
   effects. For an excellent summary, see "Xray Structure Determination",
   G.H.Stout and L.H.Jensen, Wiley, 1989.
